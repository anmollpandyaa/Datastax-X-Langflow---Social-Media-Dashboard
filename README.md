4. **Cassandra**
   - **Description**: Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers. It provides high availability without compromising performance. Cassandra is used for storing and managing the social media engagement data in this project.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Decentralized architecture
     - Linear scalability
     - Fault-tolerant and highly available
     - Data model based on tables and columns, rather than rows

5. **DataStax**
   - **Description**: DataStax provides a cloud-native database platform built on Apache Cassandra. AstraDB is DataStax's fully-managed database-as-a-service offering, allowing developers to run Cassandra-based applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. In this project, AstraDB is used to store and retrieve social media engagement data.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Fully managed cloud service
     - Built-in security and scalability
     - Serverless architecture
     - Real-time analytics capabilities

6. **Langflow**
   - **Description**: Langflow is a tool used to build and manage language models (LLMs) and analytics workflows. It allows the integration of machine learning models and data analytics to make data-driven decisions. In this project, Langflow is used to analyze social media data stored in AstraDB, providing insights such as average likes, shares, and comments for different post types.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Easy integration with data sources and LLMs
     - Support for building data pipelines
     - AI-driven analytics
     - Workflow automation

7. **GitHub**
   - **Description**: GitHub is a platform for version control and collaborative development. It is used to store and manage the codebase, allowing multiple developers to contribute and track changes. In this project, GitHub is used to maintain the source code and documentation, as well as track the project's progress.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Version control with Git
     - Collaboration through pull requests
     - Issue tracking and project management tools

8. **GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Server**
   - **Description**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides cloud computing services that run on the same infrastructure used by Google's internal products. In this project, a GCP server is used to deploy and host the application, enabling the integration of the backend with external systems like AstraDB and Langflow.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Scalable and flexible cloud infrastructure
     - Wide range of cloud services (compute, storage, database, etc.)
     - High availability and security
     - Managed services for application deployment and monitoring

## Features


1. **Data Storage with AstraDB**:
   - The system leverages **Datastax AstraDB** for secure and scalable cloud database storage. It stores key engagement metrics such as **likes**, **shares**, **comments**, and **post type** (carousel, reels, static images).
   - AstraDB provides a fully managed and highly available NoSQL database solution that ensures fast data retrieval and scalability as the data grows.

2. **Social Media Engagement Analytics**:
   - By integrating **Langflow**, the system processes and analyzes the social media engagement data stored in AstraDB.
   - Langflow provides analytics capabilities by utilizing advanced AI models and custom logic to calculate average engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) for each post type (e.g., carousel, reels, static images).
   - Users can query the system to retrieve specific engagement data and gain insights into post performance.

3. **Post Type Segmentation**:
   - The system categorizes posts into different types, including **carousel**, **reels**, and **static images**.
   - For each post type, the system computes **average likes**, **average shares**, and **average comments** to understand how each post format performs on social media platforms.

4. **Dynamic Querying via Java API**:
   - The system allows dynamic querying of engagement data based on the selected post type.
   - Users can easily request average engagement metrics by providing the post type as an input, and the system returns a comprehensive analysis, including likes, comments, and shares.

5. **Seamless Integration of Backend & Frontend**:
   - The backend system, developed in **Java**, communicates with **AstraDB** to retrieve data efficiently and accurately.
   - The data is processed using **Langflow**, and the results are made available for display or further analytics.

6. **Robust API Integration**:
   - The system integrates **AstraDB API** for seamless data access and retrieval.
   - It utilizes a **Java-based HTTP client** to send requests to AstraDB, manage authentication with API keys, and parse the response using **JSON** to extract the relevant engagement metrics.

7. **User-Friendly Dashboard**:
   - Although not yet implemented as a UI, the system can be extended to provide a user interface that presents the analytics in a readable and visually appealing format (e.g., bar graphs or line charts for engagement metrics).
   - The backend outputs the average engagement metrics, which can easily be integrated with a frontend to create a user-friendly dashboard.

8. **Scalability and Flexibility**:
   - The use of **AstraDB** ensures that the system can scale as data volume increases. The architecture is designed to handle growing engagement data without sacrificing performance.
   - New post types or engagement metrics can be easily added to the system, making it adaptable to evolving analytics requirements.
